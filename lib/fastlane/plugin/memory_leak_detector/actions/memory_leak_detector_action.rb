        "The Memory Leak Detector is a Fastlane plugin designed to help iOS developers detect memory leaks during builds or tests. By integrating with Xcodeâ€™s Instruments tool, it automatically scans the app for potential memory leaks and provides detailed reports, including information about the affected classes and objects. This plugin streamlines the process of identifying and addressing memory management issues, improving the stability and performance of iOS applications."
